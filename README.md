# Weather_Application

### First Stage
Creating an online weather application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is remarkably straightforward. JavaScript allows you to fetch weather data from various APIs, HTML provides the structure to display information, and CSS lets you style the application to your liking. With these powerful tools, you can develop a user-friendly weather app with minimal effort, making it accessible to anyone interested in checking the weather forecast. But for now the first stage prototype was using the HTML with bit of CSS style.
